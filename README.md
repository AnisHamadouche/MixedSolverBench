## RPFOSolver Benchmark

RPFOSolverBench (Reduced-precision First Order Solver Benchmark) is an open-source MATLAB benchmark for fist-order convex optimization solvers. RPFOSolverBench implements the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) and the Proximal-gradient Descent (PGD) under different floating-point and fixed-point machine representations. 

**Current version:** 1.0.0

**Release notes:** 

* The current version only implements PGD and ADMM for the LASSO problem.

* Other first-order solvers and other problems will be added in future releases.

RPFOSolver Benchmark implements PG and ADMM to solve the LASSO problem

RPFOSolver Benchmark offers a choice to solve problem (1) using different custom data types and compares the output of each to the default double precision floating-point representation.

Type
 	>> pg_benchmarking
OR
	>> admm_benchmarking
with custom problem data (modify the data) or use the default randomly generated problem data to compare the LASSO function values under different machine representations. The default benchmark implements PG and ADMM under 'double precision', 'single precision', '12 bits fixed-point' and  '16 bits fixed-point' representations. 

To add custom data types add a case statement with custom data type name. To invoke a specific type within another function use  
	>> T = mytypes('data type');
then use casting as follows:
	>> x = cast(x0, 'like', T.x)

To optimize the data type for a specific application run 'pg_solv_mex'. Note that an html static version and a Matlab data export file version of the instrumentation report are generated by default which can be found in the 'instrumentation' folder. The report is updated with new data after each benchmarking run.

**NOTE:** _this is a research code, and is under active development. You may find 
some undocumented inputs and options that are being used for development 
purposes, in the hope that they will become part of the "official" release. If 
you have any suggestions for improvement, or find any bugs, feel free to [contact us](#Contacts)!_
